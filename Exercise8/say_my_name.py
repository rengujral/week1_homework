first_name = "Sheldon"
# "first_name" in this example is a variable. A variable stores data or information of various data types.
# In this case the data stored is a string called "Sheldon".
last_name = "Cooper"
# "last_name" is another variable. In this case the variable is storing the string "Cooper".
print(first_name + " " + last_name)
# print is an in-built python function which outputs the arguments within the function and logs it to the run window/console.
# In this particular print function is the first variable which is then concatenated with a string with a space,
# and finally the second variable "last_name" which outputs "Sheldon Cooper" to the console.
